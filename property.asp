   <p>I would first classify myself as a <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8040_1.html">secular humanist</a> and atheist. I am also a <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/" title="Skeptic Magazine">skeptic</a>. I believe everything lies within the realm of science.</p>
   <blockquote cite="http://www.humanist.net/"><p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Humanists take responsibility for their own morals and their own lives, and for the lives of their communities and the world in which we live. Humanists emphasize reason and scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values and compassion, and the need for tolerance and cooperation.</p><div style="text-align: right;">&mdash;<a href="http://www.humanist.net/">The American Humanist Association</a></div></blockquote>
   <p>My economic and political beliefs coincide with those of the <a href="http://greenparty.org/">Green Party</a>.</p>
   <blockquote cite="http://greenparty.org/Platform.html"><p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Green politics is an ecological approach to politics that links social and ecological problems. Ecology studies the relationships among organisms and their environment. Political ecology brings human institutions and ideologies into this holistic perspective. The Greens carry forward the traditional values of the Left: freedom, equality, and solidarity. We want to create a truly democratic <u>society without class exploitation or social domination</u>.</p><div style="text-align: right;">&mdash;Preamble, <a href="http://greenparty.org/Platform.html">Platform of the Greens</a></div></blockquote>
   <p>Unlike many, I don't consider operating system or platform choice to be religion. I personally prefer <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Microsoft operating systems</a> based on the NT kernel: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/">Windows NT</a> (used for three years), <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/">Windows 2000</a> (two years), <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/">Windows XP</a> (several months). An operating system is a means, not an end; it's not worth <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/holy-wars.html" title="Jargon File's entry for 'holy wars'">fighting over</a>. Use what you like and let others do the same.</p>

   <p>Occasionally an interesting idea will blindside me on the way home from a movie and I'll write it down. If I believe a similar insight has already been documented, I won't even bother. The first is most prolific, having been on <a href="http://slashdot.org/science/00/03/28/0810229.shtml">Slashdot (28 Mar 2000)</a> as "a great essay" and <a href="http://www.crank.net/et.html">Crank Dot Net (17 Jun 2001)</a> as "fringe." I haven't decided which is the better description. The third was more of a formal plea for a browser feature and is based on accepted design conventions.</p>

   <p>I've only written one publically-available program, <a href="software/numtotext.zip" title="Download Number to Text">Number to Text</a>. It converts positive and negative, integer and fractional numbers with up to 239 digits to their word equivalent. Since it's only one small executable, it has no install routine but does require <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=12704">Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Run-time files (msvbvm60.dll)</a>. If you are a software developer who would like to include Number to Text's functionality transparently in your program, please <a href="interaction.html#electronic">contact me</a> about licensing.</p>
   <p><a href="software/numtotext.zip">Download Number to Text version 1.6.2 from dayah.com</a> or if you'd feel safer, <a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10106-100-1595390.html?tag=st.dl.10001-103-1.lst-7-1.1595390">get it from c|net's Download.com</a>.</p>

   <p>Years ago, I made web sites just for fun. Most well-known was <a href="http://www.lacey-chabert.com/">Lacey Nicole Chabert - The Premier Lacey Chabert Web Site</a>, the highest-trafficked <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Chabert,+Lacey" title="Details on the teen starlet from the Internet Movie Database">Lacey Chabert</a> site on the web. It has fallen into a state of disrepair after nearly three years without an update. If you're interested in maintaining content (for free), please <a href="interaction.html#electronic">contact me</a>.</p>
   <p>Another frequently-visited site is a <a href="periodic/">periodic table</a> made four years ago while recovering from <a href="toes/" title="Journal of my ingrown toenail diagnosis, surgery, and recovery">toe surgery</a>. It received over <a href="periodic/about.html">seventy awards</a> and was featured in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/chb0514.htm">USA Today (14 May 1998)</a>, <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/15/2150211.shtml">Slashdot (15 Feb 1999)</a> as the "Mega HTML Periodic Table," and <a href="http://www.golem.de/9902/2615.html">Golem News (16 Feb 1999)</a>.</p>
